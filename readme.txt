# Parameter Competition Balancing for Model Merging (PCB-Merging)

#### Source Code
We release the source code for cross-task merging experiments, including `nlp_src` and `vision_src`. More code will be released once the paper is accepted.

#### Appendix and Checklist
We provide the appendix and checklist for our paper, both in a PDF file.

#### Samples of Results
We report an experiment output with merging multiple (IA)^3 models.

#### Key Steps in Our Proposed PCB-Merging
We release an implementation of the key steps in our proposed method, including intra-balancing, inter-balancing, drop and rescale, as shown in `pcb-merging.py`. In addition, we include the implementation of evolutionary strategies.
